                <h1>Data Deletion Request</h1>
                <p>You have the right to request the permanent deletion of your game account data. This page explains the process.</p>
                
                <h2>What Data Is Deleted?</h2>
                <p>When you request data deletion, we will permanently remove your player account from our backend service (Microsoft PlayFab). This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your game progress and high scores.</li>
                    <li>Your virtual currency balance.</li>
                    <li>All skins and other items you have earned or acquired.</li>
                    <li>Any other data directly associated with your PlayFab Player ID.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This action is permanent and irreversible. Once your data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. You will lose all progress and items associated with your account.
                </div>

                <h2>How to Request Deletion</h2>
                <p>To process your request, we need to identify your account. Please follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Find Your Player ID:</strong> You must include your unique Player ID in your request.
                        <br>
                        <em><strong>Note for Developer:</strong> You need to add a feature in your game's settings or profile screen that clearly displays the user's "PlayFab Player ID" so they can copy it.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Send an Email:</strong> Compose an email to our support address: <a href="mailto:williamprv@outlook.com">williamprv@outlook.com</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use a Specific Subject Line:</strong> To help us process your request quickly, please use the subject line: <strong>AgainstALL - Data Deletion Request</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Include Your Player ID:</strong> In the body of the email, please clearly state your PlayFab Player ID.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
                <p>Once we receive your email, we will verify your Player ID and schedule your account for deletion. The entire process may take up to 30 days. We will notify you by email once the deletion is complete.</p>
                <p>Uninstalling the game from your device does not automatically delete your server-side data, so you must follow the process above if you wish for your data to be removed.</p>
